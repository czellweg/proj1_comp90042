Project 1: README

This project contains a Java project named lucene-test and a Python project
named index-compression.

Lucene-test contains an executable jar file with which a postings-file can be
generated which then is used in the index-compression module. See the README in
that project for further details on how to use it. There is already a postings-
file.txt in the index-compression project which is ready to be used and was in
fact used to get the results for the discussion.

index-compression contains Python implementations of two compression
algorithms, namely a Variable Byte Encoding method and an algorithm based on
Elias' Gamma codes. The two modules 'indexcompression' and the test module
'test_indexcompression' can both be executed as expected.
